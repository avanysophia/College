            <h2>🌟Our story</h2>
            <p>BookStop was created by a team of aspiring developers as a part of a beginner-level HTML and CSS project. What started as a classroom assignment soon turned into a creative adventure where we learned how to design, structure, and style a fully responsive multi-page website.</p>
            <p>Through this project, we wanted to go beyond textbook examples and build something meaningful—something that feels like a real-world bookstore.</p>
            <h2>💡Our mission</h2>
            <p>
        Our mission is simple: To create a clean, user-friendly, and aesthetically pleasing platform that mimics the experience of a modern online bookstore—<strong>using only HTML and CSS</strong>.
      </p>
      <p>
        We aim to inspire fellow students and beginners to start building websites with confidence, even with just the basics.
      </p>
      <h2>👨‍💻 Our Team</h2>
      <p>
        We’re a group of Computer Science students from NSS College of Engineering, who love turning code into creativity. Each page of this website was designed and styled collaboratively, giving each member a chance to contribute and grow.
      </p>
      <p>
        Whether you’re here for inspiration, learning, or just curious browsing—we hope you enjoy the BookStop experience!
